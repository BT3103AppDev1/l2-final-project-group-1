## Executive Summary 

Project management is essential for the success of any organization, but the majority of companies struggle to complete their projects successfully due to various internal and external issues. Internal issues such as scope creep, poor communication channels, and lack of risk management processes can lead to increased costs and delays. External issues such as stakeholder engagement and communication can result in unexpected risks and delays.

To address these issues, there is a critical need for a web application that provides an omni-platform for all employees and stakeholders. The application would streamline project management by providing effective communication channels, risk management features, and efficient resource utilization. By addressing both internal and external issues, the application would increase the chances of project success, benefiting the organization as a whole.
